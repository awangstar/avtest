          <h2>Who We Are</h2>
          <p id="who">Engineers by training, European by blood, 
            American-made, and firm believers that together, we can transform our future. Our lives changed forever when we discovered fashion is the #2 polluting industry after big oil. As entrepreneurs, we saw a golden opportunity not only to offer the fashion world a fresh contemporary line, but also to develop ethical, sustainable and affordable products where there were none.</p>

            <p>Liberated from the toxic chemicals used
              in traditional cotton production, our 100% certified organic cotton stands out among our peers. Our preferred partner is an organic cooperative in Peru to ensure our fibres are superior in quality. Our cotton and cotton blends are durable, smooth and have a sensuous finish that feels delightful against your skin.

            <h3>Recycled Polyester</h3>
            <p>We went the extra mile to create our recycled polyester and polyester blends. The result of some feats of engineering, our fibres come from 100% recycled material and are spun to be ultra soft and flattering. Although polyester (developed in a laboratory in the 1940’s) is nonrenewable, it is highly recyclable and adheres to our Zero Waste design philosophy.

            <h3>Linen</h3>
            <p>Not all linens are created equal. Most commercial linen is saturated with solvents that stay trapped in the fabric for years. Our linen is crafted through a gentle mechanical process that involves only friction and pure water. Spun from the highest quality Italian Flax available, our linen is calming, naturally hypoallergenic and is incredibly fresh and cool in warmer temperatures.  </p>
